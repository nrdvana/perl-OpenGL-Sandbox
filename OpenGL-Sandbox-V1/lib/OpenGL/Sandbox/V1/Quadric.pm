# ABSTRACT - Rendering parameters for various geometric shapes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  default_quadric->normals(GLU_SMOOTH)->texture(1)->sphere(100, 42, 42);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GLU Quadrics are a funny name for a small object that holds a few rendering parameters for
another few geometry-plotting functions.  They provide a quick/convenient way to render some
simple solids without messing with a bunch of trigonometry and loops.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Each of these is write-only.  They return the object for convenient chaining.

=head2 draw_style

  $q->draw_style($x)  # GLU_FILL, GLU_LINE, GLU_SILHOUETTE, GL_POINT

You can also use aliases of:

=over

=item C<draw_fill>

=item C<draw_line>

=item C<draw_silhouette>

=item C<draw_point>

=back

=head2 normals

  $q->normals($x)  # GLU_NONE, GLU_FLAT, GLU_SMOOTH

You can also use aliases of:

=over

=item C<no_normals>, or normals(0)

=item C<flat_normals>

=item C<smooth_normals>

=back

=head2 orientation

  $q->orientation($x)   # GLU_OUTSIDE, GLU_INSIDE

You can also use aliases of

=over

=item C<inside>

=item C<outside>

=back

=head2 texture

  $q->texture($bool)    # GL_TRUE, GL_FALSE

=head1 GEOMETRY PLOTTING

=head2 sphere

  $q->sphere($radius, $slices, $stacks);

Plot a sphere around the origin with specified dimensions.

=head2 cylinder

  $q->cyliner($base_rad, $top_rad, $height, $slices, $stacks);

Plot a hollow cylinder (without ends) along the Z axis with the specified dimensions.

=head2 disk

  $q->disk($inner_rad, $outer_rad, $slices, $loops);

Plot a flat circle around the Z axis along the XY plane.  Nonzero inner radius
"subtracts" a circle from the center.

=head2 partial_disk

  $q->partial_disk($inner, $outer, $slices, $loops, $start, $sweep);

Plot a wedge of a disk around the Z axis.
